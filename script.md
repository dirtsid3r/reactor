# N.R.R.C Emergency Briefing Video Script

## Opening: Warning Alarm & Logo

*[Alarm sounds briefly, N.R.R.C logo appears with emergency lights flashing]*

## Scene 1: Welcome

**Director of Operations (serious tone):**

Welcome to the Nuclear Carbon Recycling Reactor facility. I'm Dr. Eliza Chen, Director of Operations.

I wish I could greet you under better circumstances, but we have an emergency situation. There's been a catastrophic system failure in our main reactor control systems.

## Scene 2: Explaining the Situation

**Director of Operations:**

The N.R.R.C is a next-generation facility designed to actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into useful synthetic fuels. 

Unfortunately, a cascading system failure has triggered emergency lockdown protocols. The reactor is offline, all personnel have been evacuated... except for you.

*[Display shows reactor schematic with all components flashing red]*

For reasons we still don't understand, the security override failed in your section. You're now sealed inside the control room until the reactor is either repaired or... well, let's focus on the repair part.

## Scene 3: The Challenge

**Director of Operations:**

The good news is that you can restore the system from your terminal. The bad news? You have approximately 45 minutes before we reach critical failure.

*[Countdown timer appears on screen]*

Each reactor component requires a specific passphrase to reboot. These passphrases are hidden throughout the facility, within puzzles designed as a security measure.

*[Brief montage showing various puzzles/components]*

Your terminal interface will guide you through each component repair. Your goal is simple: solve all nine puzzles, enter the correct passphrases, and restore the reactor before time runs out.

## Scene 4: Resources Available

**Director of Operations:**

You'll have access to:

1. A reactor schematic showing your repair progress
2. The E.C.H.O. AI assistant who can provide hints if you're stuck
3. A terminal interface for entering passphrases

*[Screen shows split view of these components]*

If at any point you need assistance, E.C.H.O. can provide guidance. Just don't expect it to be... straightforward. Our AI development team had an unusual sense of humor.

## Scene 5: Humor & Encouragement

**Director of Operations:**

*[Smiles awkwardly]*

I should mention that despite this being a potentially catastrophic situation, our emergency protocols insist I remind you to "stay calm and think clearly." Corporate also wants me to emphasize this is "an opportunity for team growth and problem-solving excellence."

*[Rolls eyes slightly]*

Between you and me, just focus on not letting the reactor melt down. I've grown rather attached to this hemisphere.

## Scene 6: Final Instructions

**Director of Operations:**

The clock is ticking. Each puzzle you solve will increase reactor stability. Solve all nine, and you'll restore full functionality and unlock the doors.

Good luck. The facility—and quite possibly your weekend plans—depend on your success.

*[Transmission begins to break up]*

I'm losing connection... Remember, 45 minutes... every puzzle counts... and whatever you do, don't let E.C.H.O. convince you that—

*[Transmission cuts out, N.R.R.C logo appears with "EMERGENCY PROTOCOL ACTIVATED" text]*

*[Video ends, transition to game interface]*
