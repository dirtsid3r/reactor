P001,Blocking generator,"-Letter that is riped into pieces
-Magnifier 
-QR code players scan to submit answer
-Computer to submit answer","The reactor’s intake system is blocked because it can’t identify the main pollutant it’s supposed to capture.
The sensors are confused. You need to figure out what the reactor needs to capture.

There is a hidden message for you that can help you","- Page with a field to validate the word. It should let the users write the world, no matter if it is in Uppercase or lowercase. (case insensitive).
- Message that let the player know that the message is wrong. ""Try again"".
- Confirmation message when the answer is correct. ""You got it, this is the way""",There are clues in the letter look carefully,There is something in the room that help is see things bigger,"The letter has the answer in it, look at the icons",Is that a human trace?,"You got it! You have identified the invisible mark: the carbon footprint. This is the total amount of greenhouse gases; like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emitted by a person or organization. It’s measured in kilograms, and by tracking this, we can see who the biggest contributors are and how our actions impact the planet.

Know the sensors know what the generator needs to capture",Carbon footprint,"Students will understand the meaning of carbon footprint, which is the metric used to measure the impact that every sector made in the planet",
P002,What is the target?,"-Computer
","The molecular disassembly chamber is malfunctioning; the lasers can't target the CO2 to decompose if it doesn't know the sources of the CO2. To calibrate the laser system, you must identify the hidden costs different categories have in our environment.","The interface could look like different lasers pointing in different places and are not aligned. When the users complete the drag-and-drop feature, the lasers can point directly to the categories.
- 4 sections: Food, Clothing, Technology services, Transportation.
- List of terms that the user can drag and drop into the categories.
-Toxic chemicals
-Water use
-Water cooling
-Fossil Fuel
-Fossil Fuel
-Deforestation
-Microplastic pollution
-Methane emissions
-Mining extraction
-Land use
-Biodiversity Loss
-Ecological Waste
",Clothes: When you wash your clothes there is something that can go into the ocean and affect the animals,"Food: The animals that we eat for our diet need a place where to live, what cost it can have?",Transportation: In order to move what source of energy do you need?,Technology: When you want to change your phone and tablet where does it go?,"You nailed it! Now the lasers know where to point. 
Our daily actions and choices impact the world. Every sector has hidden costs that we sometimes can not see but we can help reduce with small actions. For example, we can buy food grown locally, buy second-hand clothes, use different types of transportation, like walking or riding a bicycle. 

Did you know that one-third of all food produced is wasted?  Every year, wasted food in the UK represents 14 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. In total, these greenhouse gas emissions are the same as those created by 7 million cars each year.

","-clothing: Toxic chemicals, water use, and Microplastic pollution.
-Technology services: Water cooling, fossil fuel, ecological waste, and mining extraction.
-Food: Deforestation, Methane emission, Land use, Biodiversity loss.
-Transportation: Fossil fuel","Students will start to understand that every sector contributes differently and by dragging and dropping the terms, they can visually see the hidden cost. They can start thinking that there are some actions that we can take to help the planet, such as buying second-hand clothes and food that grows locally. ",
P003,Power Plant Leak,-Paper,"At the power plant control room, there’s an energy leak happening because some machines are still drawing power even though they're not running properly.
