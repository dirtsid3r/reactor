# N.R.R.C ESCAPE ROOM: NARRATIVE STORYBOARD

## OPENING SCENE

*A group of 4-6 players are escorted into a high-tech laboratory setting. The room is dimly lit with emergency red lights pulsing. Scientific equipment, papers, and various technological devices are scattered across workstations.*

A security officer leads the group into what appears to be the main control room of a scientific facility. The officer appears tense.

**Security Officer:** "You're the research team that was called in, right? Thank god you're here. There's been an incident. The main staff had to evacuate, but the automated lockdown system has malfunctioned. I need to secure the perimeter, but you'll be safe in here... at least for now."

*The officer hurriedly exits, and an electronic CLICK sounds as the door locks behind them.*

## SCENE 1: THE EMERGENCY TRANSMISSION

*The lab's main computer terminal suddenly activates. A countdown timer appears on screen: 45:00 minutes and counting down.*

*The screen flickers, and a video transmission begins playing. Dr. Eliza Chen, Director of Operations, appears on screen. Her expression is grave.*

**Dr. Chen:** "Welcome to the Nuclear Carbon Recycling Reactor facility. I'm Dr. Eliza Chen, Director of Operations. I wish I could greet you under better circumstances, but we have an emergency situation. There's been a catastrophic system failure in our main reactor control systems."

**Dr. Chen:** "The N.R.R.C is a next-generation facility designed to actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into useful synthetic fuels. Unfortunately, a cascading system failure has triggered emergency lockdown protocols. The reactor is offline, all personnel have been evacuated... except for you."

*The screen displays a reactor schematic with all components flashing red.*

**Dr. Chen:** "For reasons we still don't understand, the security override failed in your section. You're now sealed inside the control room until the reactor is either repaired or... well, let's focus on the repair part."

## SCENE 2: THE CHALLENGE IS SET

**Dr. Chen:** "The good news is that you can restore the system from your terminal. The bad news? You have approximately 45 minutes before we reach critical failure."

*The countdown timer becomes more prominent on screen.*

**Dr. Chen:** "Each reactor component requires a specific passphrase to reboot. These passphrases are hidden throughout the facility, within puzzles designed as a security measure."

*The camera briefly pans around the room, showing various items, puzzles, and clues.*

**Dr. Chen:** "Your terminal interface will guide you through each component repair. Your goal is simple: solve all nine puzzles, enter the correct passphrases, and restore the reactor before time runs out."

**Dr. Chen:** "You'll have access to a reactor schematic showing your repair progress, the E.C.H.O. AI assistant who can provide hints if you're stuck, and a terminal interface for entering passphrases."

*The transmission begins to break up.*

**Dr. Chen:** "I'm losing connection... Remember, 45 minutes... every puzzle counts... and whatever you do, don't let E.C.H.O. convince you that—"

*The transmission cuts out. The terminal displays: "N.R.R.C EMERGENCY PROTOCOL ACTIVATED"*
